Using MatPlotLib in python, I have mapped words according to their occurences in a text file scraped from Gutenberg. 
Zipf's laws asserts that frequency of certain events are inversely proportional to their rank.

Zipf's law is approximately followed by almost any document of substantial length in any language, even the ones that we have not been able to decipher.
Isn't that fascinating that given our idiosyncracies we always express ourselves in "Zipfian way".
