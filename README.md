# Zipfs Law Visualizer


Using MatPlotLib in python, I have mapped words according to their occurences in a text file scraped from Gutenberg. 
Zipf's laws asserts that frequency of certain events are inversely proportional to their rank.
As a consquency of Zipfs law, we get the pareto principle famously knows as 80-20 principle.
Zipf's law is approximately followed by almost any document of substantial length in any language, even the ones that we have not been able to decipher.
Isn't that fascinating that given our idiosyncracies we always express ourselves in "Zipfian way".

Make sure you have Matplotlib installed on your device. If you dont,type on your terminal "pip install mathplotlib" without quotes and python would go on and install it
We scrape text from Gutenberg books available in public domain, For that reason BeautifulSoup is also required.
Change the address if you'd want to run the program for some other book.
